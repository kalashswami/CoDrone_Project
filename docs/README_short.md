# CoDrone Project â€” Short Notes

- Goal: evaluate flight accuracy and Python control; useable for **TEOP Saturday** sessions.
- Controller: Smart Inventor Board + BLE; Arduino Uno profile; DIP: upload(1=ON,2=OFF,3=OFF), run(all OFF).
- Joysticks: left = throttle/yaw; right = pitch/roll; left sensor = immediate landing; right sensor = soft landing.
- Python: `pip install CoDrone`; run examples in `src/`.
- Safety: open space, eye protection, keep clear of props.
